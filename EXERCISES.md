Self-learning exercises
=======================

This is a non-exhaustive list of exercises a contributor can (should) do in order to fully understand the project all the way up and learn in the process. Remember OpcodeOne is all about self-learning, and contributing/experimenting in all stages is the whole purpose of this.


1. Think about the current [assembly syntax](doc/arch/OpcodeOne_Technical_Documentation.md#assembly-syntax) and propose (reasoned) changes to make it more robust/clear/consistent
2. Think about current [instruction set](doc/arch/OpcodeOne_Technical_Documentation.md#o-instruction-set) and propose (reasoned) opcode addition/modification/removal. The *reasoned* part is important here, since is part of the design process; specify why/where/how/pros&cons about the changes proposed.
3. Think about the [OpcodeOne (OÂ¹) technical documentation](doc/arch/OpcodeOne_Technical_Documentation.md) and propose alternatives to improve it (style, layout, content).
